- 👋 Hi, I’m @paint99
- 👀 I’m interested in making applications to reduce the cost of infrastructure and reduce the negative impact on people and the environment. I'd really like to get to AI and ML but I've only been studying code for a year or so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and XAML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to help me learn. I have a background in civil engineering but my passion seems to be elsewhere. I picked up C# and I've been trying to learn as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
